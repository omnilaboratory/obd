## Nodes in testnet

Here is the list of nodes in the testnet we deployed for community use. Nodes will be updating accordingly:  

``` 
ws://62.234.216.108:60020/wstest
ws://62.234.188.160:60020/wstest
```

Some trackers for users who run your own obd nodes. You edit the configure file: `\config\conf.ini`:

```
[tracker]
hostIp = 62.234.216.108 
port = 60060
```
